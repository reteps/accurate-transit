# Frontend

## Running locally

There are two servers you need to start: the local development server and the
backend server. Start the development server in this directory with `yarn
start`. Start the backend server in `../backend/` with `yarn start`.

## Testing

To run the Cypress end-to-end test suite, first start the local development
server and the backend server. Then, start Cypress with `yarn run cypress open`.
